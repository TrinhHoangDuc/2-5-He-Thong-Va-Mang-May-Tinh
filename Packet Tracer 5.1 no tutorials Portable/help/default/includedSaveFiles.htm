<p class="MainHeading1">Included Save Files</p>
<hr>

<p>The SAVES directory of Packet Tracer contains sample network files.</p>

<p>REFERENCE TOPOLOGIES:<br>
These starter topologies were used for testing purposes. They have no instructions, but may be useful starting points for activities you would like to create.</p>

<p>Note: Personal Folders<br>
Users can create their own folders in the SAVES directory. Classroom research has shown that the earlier users learn the basics of creating Packet Tracer networks from scratch, the more they can learn from the tool. It is our hope that as you create your own Packet Tracer activities, both .pkt network files and .pka activity files, you will consider sharing them with the Academy community.</p>

<p>Notes: PT v3.2 and PT v4.0 Files<br>
PT v3.2 files can be used in PT v5.1 but please note that the backwards compatibility of PT 5.1 is limited due to fundamental changes in protocol modeling and GUI programming. However, PT v3.2 topologies may still be useful as starting points. Note that in general, you will need to adjust both the GUI features (moving devices around) and configurations (via GUI and command line interface) of the PT v3.2 files loaded into PT v5.1. PT v5.1 will open PT v4.0 network and activity files, but since PT v5.1 has considerably more protocol, device, and activity wizard features, you may still want to edit and re-save your PT v4.0 work using PT v5.1.</p>
