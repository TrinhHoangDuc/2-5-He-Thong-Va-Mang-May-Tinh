<hr>
<p>The Physical Workspace provides the dimension of distance to wireless devices. Access points can establish connections with wireless end devices that are within a certain range. This range is indicated by a gray mesh area surrounding the access point. Note that this mesh area appears as a circle or an oval depending on the dimensions of the background image used. If the background source image is square, the mesh is circular. If the background image is a rectangle, the mesh is oval, scaled by the width and height of the source image.</p>

<p class="myList">In this example, three wireless-enabled PCs and two access points are created. They have all been moved from the default wiring closet and placed directly onto the "streets" of the city (for demonstration purposes). Note the following:</p>
<p class="myList">&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>PC0 is within the wireless range of Access Point0, so it associates with Access Point0.</li>
  <li>PC1 is within the wireless range of both Access Point0 and AccessPoint1. However, because it is closer to Access Point1, it associates with Access Point1.</li>
  <li>PC2 is not in range of any access point, so it has no connectivity.</li>
</ul>
