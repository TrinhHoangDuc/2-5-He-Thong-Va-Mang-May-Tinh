<p class="MainHeading1">The Physical Workspace
<hr>
<p>
  
  The purpose of the Physical Workspace is to give a physical dimension to your logical network topology. It gives you a sense of scale and placement (how your network might look in a real environment). </p>
<p>The Physical Workspace is divided into four layers to reflect the physical scale of four environments: Intercity, City, Building, and Wiring Closet. The intercity is the largest environment. It can contain many cities. Each city can contain many buildings. Finally, each building can contain many wiring closets. The wiring closet view is where you actually see the devices you created in the Logical Workspace; they are arranged in networking racks and on tables.</p>
<p>When you first enter the Physical Workspace, you are in the Intercity view (or "map").</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By default, the intercity contains one city called "Home City." You can click and drag the <strong>City</strong> icon to move it around in the intercity map. You can also simply click on the <strong>City</strong> icon to zoom to the  map of that city.</p>

<p>The Home City also contains one default building called "Corporate Office." This building also can be moved anywhere around the city. Click on the <strong>Building</strong> icon to zoom to the  interior of that building. All buildings are limited to one floor. From the City view, you can also return to the Intercity environment by clicking on the <strong>Intercity</strong> button in the Physical Workspace Bar.</p>

<p>The Corporate Office contains one default wiring closet called "Main Wiring Closet." Click its icon to view its contents. You can also return to any of the previous environments (Intercity or City) by clicking the corresponding buttons in the Physical Workspace Bar.</p>

<p>The "Main Wiring Closet" initially houses all the devices that you created in the Logical Workspace. It neatly arranges devices onto racks and tables so you can see where your devices physically are. Learn how to move these devices around in the building or even the city in the "Moving Devices" section.</p>
