<hr />
<p align="left">Users of Packet Tracer 3.2 and 4.0 will note a variety of new features in Packet Tracer 5.1.</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Protocol Improvements</p>

<p><change type="both" id="1" />
Packet Tracer 5.1 models protocols not included in earlier versions. These protocols include models of IPv6 Routing, IPv6 and IPv4 Dual Stack, IPv6 ND, IPv6 Routing Protocols, DHCPv6, NATv6, Multi-Area OSPF, Redistribution, RSTP, SSH, Multilayer Switching, and EtherChannel. Also, a model of the Cisco Catalyst 3560-24PS Multilayer Switch has been added.</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Extendable Architecture</p>

<p>Packet Tracer is designed in a modular fashion for future expansion and the Packet Tracer team is interested in learning what new features would be most useful to the community. For example, with the Inter-Process Communication (IPC) feature, it enables external applications (ExApps) to be added to Packet Tracer to extend its functionality. As a result, the IPC greatly expands the capabilities that Packet Tracer can provide without having to wait for the actual Packet Tracer core program to be enhanced.</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">GUI Improvements</p>

<p>Packet Tracer 5.1 retains the logical topology as the primary workspace but adds additional physical representations of devices, Realtime and Simulation modes, and a wide variety of views and windows. The GUI supports multiple languages so the application may be locally translated. New features included in Packet Tracer 5.1 are the following: Multiuser, ACL Filters, user profile, improved print functuality, the ability to toggle toolbars in the main interface, Desktop tab for the Server  including IP Configuration and Command Prompt dialogs, and various Activity Wizard improvements including additional locking items, the ability to import/export activity instructions, assign  point values and component categories to assessment items, lock the user profile, toggle the Dynamic Percentage Feedback, and the ability to test an activity without restarting from beginning.</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Representation and Visualization Tools</p>

<p>An Event List, a form of global network sniffer, is included in Packet Tracer 5.1. This allows the display of the majority of simulated PDUs as events. For detailed protocol analysis, these events may be played in a continuous animation mode, forward, backward or in a stepped through process. Powerful OSI Layer view and PDU view, and more sophisticated custom PDUs, are also supported.</p>

<p class="MainHeading2">Annotation and Authoring Capabilities</p>

<p>Packet Tracer 5.1 improves upon the Activity Wizard of versions 3.2 and 4.0. It also includes templates, or "design patterns," for four different types of problem-solving activities: concept builders (network modeling problems), skill builders (pre-lab and post-lab implementation and practice activities), design problems, and troubleshooting problems.</p>
