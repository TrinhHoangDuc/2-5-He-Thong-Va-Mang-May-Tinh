<p class=MainHeading2>Specific Issues</P>
<a href="#spec_01" >1. In the Physical Workspace, the wiring closet does not display all of the devices I have created in the Logical 
Workspace.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_02" >2. If I turn off the ARP filter in the Event List Filters, does that mean devices won't build ARP tables?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_03" >3. Does Packet Tracer 5.1 use the Spanning Tree Protocol?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_04" >4. How does loop-breaking process work in Packet Tracer 5.1? Why don't I have the option of viewing packets associated with the loop-breaking process?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_05" >5. When I reset the network in Simulation Mode, why do some switch ports show amber link lights and stay that color?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_06" >6. Why does the command "clockrate" not work?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_07" >7. I created a ping packet in Simulation Mode and ran it. Why do I still see packets (like CDP) running on the network after the ping process is completed?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_08" >8. When I issue an extended ping, the parameters I am asked to fill in do not match an extended ping on a real device.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_09" >9. Why can't I access sub-interfaces on serial ports?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_10" >10. Why can't I test port connectivity with a command such as ping 192.168.1.5:80?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_11" >11. Does Packet Tracer 5.1 support VTP?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_12" >12. I can't seem to add a secondary address to a port.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_13" >13. How does the Auto settings for bandwidth and duplex work on a port?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_14" >14. At the end of a simulation (after the last event), I viewed a device table (such as ARP or MAC) and saw that it was blank. Why is this?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_15" >15. Sometimes the CLI screen seems to display text incorrectly. For example, when activating an interface, the 
router prompt appears at the end of the sys log message instead of a new 
line.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_16" >16. When I make the interface a trunk port in a interface sub-panel for the switch (under Config), the VLAN range is set to 1 to 1005 even though the switch does not have that many VLANs set up?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_17" >17. When I turn off a router that has its link lights up and then turn it back on, why do the links remain down?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_18" >18. When I choose a tool from the Common Tools Bar (such as the Inspect tool), how can I cancel that tool or deselect it?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_19" >19. What's the difference between the Reset Simulation button and the Power Cycle Devices button?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_20" >20. When I use the Add Simple PDU tool to ping a router, the destination IP address is the Ethernet 
interface rather than the serial interface. What determines the default destination interface for a ping?</a><br><a href="#spec_21" >21. When I have a static route and RIP configured on a router, why is it that the static route with an administrative distance of 1 is preferred over RIP routes with an administrative distance of 120?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_22" >22. When I configure static NAT on a router and perform a ping, why does the router eventually lose the NAT translations after several successful pings?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_23" >23. When I enter an EIGRP network command, such as network 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0, the result would be network 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 instead. However, on a real router, the result is actually network 192.168.1.0.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_24" >24. When I try to do an extended ping in the CLI with a source IP address that doesn't belong to 
the device, it gives me an invalid source error message.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_25" >25. In Simulation Mode, when I only have a single Event List Filter enabled, such as UDP, and then click on Capture / Forward, I get the message, "The maximum number of events has been reached..." This is counter-intuitive since no events are shown in the Event List at all.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_26" >26. When a router doesn't have a next hop MAC address, it sends an ARP request and will drop the ICMP packet as well. Is this normal behavior?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_27" >27. When I save a configuration to the router NVRAM (wr mem or copy run start), the router does not save the 
configuration when Packet Tracer 5.1 is shut down. This only occurs if you save the topology.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_28" >28. When you use the same network/subnet on two different devices, the Cisco IOS CLI reports an error saying that the IP address conflicts with another interface.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_29" >29. Which cable do I use to connect an Access Point to other networking devices? Also, why do Packet Tracer 3.2 files with access points connected to other devices no longer work?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_30" >30. What is the difference between the activity file (.pka) that I author and the activity file that I give to others?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_31" >31. Is it possible to import or open Packet Tracer 3.2 activity files?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_32" >32. What is the correct version for EIGRP? I have seen only two versions, v0 and v1. However, in the PDU Information Window, the version reported is version 2.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_33" >33. In Simulation Mode, why do some devices/ports sometimes buffer frames and say the ports are sending other frames when there are no frames shown in the Event List?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_34" >34. When creating multiple connections between the same two devices (e.g. trunking), the cables connected earlier may be hidden by the new ones. How do I know how many cables are connected?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_35" >35. Using the Activity Wizard, how do I lock out the GUI configuration for routers and switches to force the users  to use only the CLI?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_36" >36. What happens to the IP address of a device when I duplicate the device?</a><br><a href="#spec_37" >37. What is the limit for the number of wireless hosts and access points in the same coverage area?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_38" >38. When I create a template of a device with additional IOS images besides the default IOS image, only the default IOS image of the device appears in the custom device.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_39" >39. Does Realtime mode exactly model actual real world time?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_40" >40. Why, when I enable logging and configure devices in the CLI and then save the file, does the save file not save the log?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_41" >41. When I send a PDU over devices with multiple links between them, with one of the links shutdown, why does the PDU traverse the shutdown link instead of the active link in Simulation Mode?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_42" >42. Why do I get two different average round trip times for the exact same pings in Realtime Mode and Simulation Mode?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_43" >43. When I issue the "clear ip route *" command in CLI, it doesn't clear the routing tables.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_44" >44. Why can't enable secret passwords be assessed reliably in activities?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_45" >45. I can add a WEP key that is out of the hex range for the Linksys router when I shouldn't be able to.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_46" >46. In the Event List filter window, why does unchecking HTTP filter have no effect when TCP is checked?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_47" >47. Why does the Inspect tool have no effect on the Linksys router?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_48" >48. When I telnet into another device, the config tab does not work.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_49" >49. Why do static routes with admin distances of 255 show up on the routing table? </a><br>
<a href="#spec_50" >50. Packet Tracer 5.1 crashes when I have many instances of Packet Tracer 5.1 opened.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_51" >51. How can configurations from Packet Tracer 4.x, Packet Tracer 5.1, and real devices be used in activities to check enable secret and other passwords with service password-encryption on?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_52" >52. Why are values in Config tab not changed when I have already changed them in console?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_53" >53. Why do HTTP packets still show up when I have the HTTP filter unchecked?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_54" >54. Why does Packet Tracer 5.1 generate the same encryption string when the same password is entered more than once?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_55" >55. How do I add a graphic image in activity instructions?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_56" >56. Why am I able to add and remove content from the activity instructions window when it should be read-only?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_57" >57. When I enter "show interface s0/0/0" in the CLI, the IOS output says "show interface s0/0/0" is an ambiguous command.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_58" >58. How come I cannot use Variable Manager for scoring with VLAN interface IDs (SVIs)?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_59" >59. Is there a way to speed up convergence of the network when I open a file?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_60" >60. I cannot make a Multiuser connection between Windows and Linux machines.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_61" >61. I can still access the Config tab of a router or switch even if there is an enable secret password in the running configuration.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_62" >62. Is there a way to distinguish between outgoing and incoming Multiuser remote network clouds? Also, when I have an incoming Multiuser connection, Packet Tracer creates a Multiuser remote network cloud if the name is incorrect.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_63" >63. When I try to set a variable value to Elemental Position in Variable Manager, the value sets itself to zero and cannot be changed to any other position.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_64" >64. When I try to copy text from the CLI tab using "Ctrl + C", the output has unorganized text that can be dragged around.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_65" >65. How come I am able to enter negative point values for Assessment Items in activities?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_66" >66. Can a wireless PC associate to an access point that is from a Multiuser remote network?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_67" >67. When I try to create a loop on a switch by connecting a straight-through or cross-over cable to different ports on the same switch, I get a connection error stating that "The cable cannot be connected to that port?"</a><br>
<a href="#spec_68" >68. How come when I have multiple wireless profiles in a wireless PC and then delete the wireless router that the wireless PC is currently associated to, the wireless PC does not automatically associate to the other wireless routers that has a profile?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_69" >69. In Physical Workspace, sometimes the geoicons do not work correctly. For example, I am able to move the geoicons beyond the "border." Also, the geoicon labels are sometimes detached from the geoicon itself after navigating between locations.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_70" >70. How come the output for various commands in the CLI, such as "show ipv6 nat translations," is different from a real router?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_71" >71. When I click on Save Settings in the Applications & Gaming section in the Linksys GUI, the last item in focus does not save.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_72" >72. How come when I create a complex PDU, the Outgoing Port drop-down list does not contain any interfaces?</a><br>
<a href="#spec_73" >73. The Variable Manager Interface in the Activity Wizard Answer Network panel is too narrow.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_74" >74. When I have a router with 2 LANs (e.g. 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.2.1), a PC with an IP address in the 192.168.1.0 network can be pinged by a PC in the 192.168.2.0 network even if the PC in the 192.168.1.0 network has the incorrect default gateway (e.g. 192.168.2.1).</a><br>
<a href="#spec_75" >75. When I copy and paste the entire "show running-config" output in Global Config Mode, some commands return "% Invalid input detected at '^' marker."</a><br>
<a href="#spec_76" >76. When I undo a deleted device/link that was connected to a Multiuser remote network, Packet Tracer crashes.</a><br>
<a href="#spec_77" >77. When I delete a link to a Multiuser remote network, the link isn't removed from the Multiuser remote network.</a><br>

<p class=MainHeading2>Protocol Modeling Issues</P>
<a href="#mod_1" >1. For EIGRP, why are new adjacencies being formed after the "no auto" command--this does not happen on real routers?</a><br>
<a href="#mod_2" >2. Why does the "no keepalive" command give me an error saying I must set the encapsulation to Frame Relay?</a><br>
<a href="#mod_3" >3. On real devices, the link lights would still come up if there is a duplex mismatch between both sides of the Ethernet connection. Why does Packet Tracer not model this behavior?</a><br>
<a href="#mod_4" >4. On real switches, if there is a native VLAN mismatch on both sides of the same trunk, CDP and STP would print out error messages. Why does Packet Tracer not model that?</a><br>
<a href="#mod_5" >5. I cannot disable STP on switching devices.</a><br><a href="#mod_6" >6. On a real device, I can ping the loopback address 127.0.0.1, what about in Packet Tracer?</a><br>
<a href="#mod_7" >7. On a real router, I can configure an interface with a valid IP address and subnet mask even though it is a supernet, but in Packet Tracer it says that the subnet mask is a "Bad mask."</a><br>
<a href="#mod_8" >8. I cannot configure an IP address on a modem interface module, but there is a configuration interface in the Config tab.</a><br>
<a href="#mod_9" >9. If there is a DHCP request with two or more DHCP servers, and then a DHCP request fails due to a possible collision when the DHCP servers try to respond simultaneously, there should be lots of traffic but there are no further events after the collision.</a><br>
<a href="#mod_10" >10. Why doesn't STP block the ports if the native VLAN mismatches?</a><br>
<a href="#mod_11" >11. On a real router, the timer is reset for OSPF and EIGRP routes after a "clear ip route *" command, but not in Packet Tracer 5.1.</a><br>
<a href="#mod_12" >12. Why does the Linksys remote management override HTTP port forwarding?</a><br>
<a href="#mod_13" >13. The show ip ospf neighbor command shows a priority of 1. Actual 1841 shows priority of 0.</a><br>
<a href="#mod_14" >14. Static routes with 255 admin distance should not be added to routing table.</a><br>
<a href="#mod_15" >15. Why do wireless ports always buffer the frames before sending?</a><br>
<a href="#mod_16" >16. Why are LMI statistics not updated when the link state changes?</a><br>
<a href="#mod_17" >17. Why can I only ping one VLAN interface on the switch when there are more than one with the status and line protocol up?</a><br>
<a href="#mod_18" >18. Why does OSPF not work over physical serial interface using frame relay?</a><br>
<a href="#mod_19" >19. In Simulation Mode, routing tables are updated before the packet arrives in the simulation.</a><br>
<a href="#mod_20" >20. On a router with multiple switching modules, there should be individual MAC tables for each switching module. However, "show mac-address table" shows only one MAC table.</a><br>
<a href="#mod_21" >21. Why is the command "ip ospf network" not available in the loopback interface mode?</a><br>
<a href="#mod_22" >22. The round trip times for pings in Multiuser networks are very long. </a><br>
<a href="#mod_23" >23. When I issue the command "debug ppp negotiate" before enabling PPP encapsulation, debug messages do not show.</a><br>
<a href="#mod_24" >24. On a real switch, when I create a VLAN and then assign a name to the VLAN, VTP revision number increases by 1. In Packet Tracer, the VTP revision number increases by 2.</a><br>

      80 for remote management. On a real Linksys router, it uses port 80 on the 
      LAN side and port 8080 on the Internet port. The current implementation of 
      Packet Tracer 5.1 determines whether or not to allow remote management by 
      using an ACL on the Internet port that blocks all traffic to port 80.</P>
      <p>The workaround is to enable remote management on 
      the Linksys router. This allows traffic to port 80 into the device. NAT 
      then translates to the IP address on the destination device and then sends it 
      out to the destination device.</P></td></tr>

    <td>Why do wireless ports always buffer the frames before sending?</td>
    <td>This is because the wireless port is doing CSMA/CA and sends a Request To Send
(RTS) before sending any data frame.  It then has to receive a Clear To Send
(CTS) from the destination device before sending the data frame. Packet Tracer 5.1 is not showing the wireless management frames, so it would show the data
frames being buffered without seeing any other frames.</td></tr>

    <td>The 2950 switch allows only one active VLAN interface up at a time. However, the 2960 switch and the ISR routers allow multiple. To bridge the gap between the more -used 2960 switch, ISR routers and our modeling, we allow multiple
VLAN interfaces to be up at the same time.  However, to minimize the risk of
changing some major components at testing stage, we do not allow multiple VLAN
interfaces to have layer 3 functionality.</td>
